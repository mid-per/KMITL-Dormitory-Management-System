# KMITL-Dormitory-Management-System
KMITL dormitory management system project is just a console application without graphics. Come with a login and registration system. 
This project mainly uses file handling to perform basic operations like adding, editing, searching, and deleting occupant data using files; these are only accessible by an admin account. For a regular occupant account, the system can show occupant records alphabetically with a few filter options. (ofc the admin can call this too) 
occupant struct will contain gender data, room info, and rent status. When calling for the record, the system will show all the data in the struct. 
The main screen or display in the console will be coded using conio.h.
